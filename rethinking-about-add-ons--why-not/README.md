Rethinking about Add-ons! Why not?
==================================

This presentation have its goals on the Marcio Galli quote bellow:

"Remember to call the guys for * THE REAL QUEST = to reinvent what is a browser extension. I think we got to the point of turning the thing upside down and kick tecnobalde"

https://etherpad.mozilla.org/mozcamp-tpl

The proposal is to talk about what can we do to take the Addons to another level! How can we rethink the Addons different or do something different that we have done until today!
The talk is more philosophical than technical, because I'll not show codes, but I'll show some technical thoughts!
The idea is shake the mind of the community member and open some discussions about this theme in the MozCamp!
O little roadmap about the talk:
- How was the addons (or extension :-P) in the early days of Firefox
 * Development things and Interaction with Users
- How we think about addons today
- What is the next steps that we want to think about the addons to take them to another level! This includes the interaction between the User and Firefox, and how the developers want to think before do an Addon
